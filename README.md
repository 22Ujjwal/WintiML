## 1. [My library Documentation webscapper [creates HTML file]](https://github.com/22Ujjwal/WintiML/blob/main/MyLibWebScapperToHTML.py)
**Fetches data from websites and present it in a structured and visually appealing format, enhancing data quality and organization**

## 2. [My library Documentation webscapper [creates markdown file]](https://github.com/22Ujjwal/WintiML/blob/main/MyLibWebScapper.py)
**Works well for parsing through other websites which has mutilple sectioned data**

## 3. First Agentic AI 🦾
**Helps as a personal Crypto agent sharing personal analysis using Phidata framework and LLMs**

## 4. [SAS Project (Data Science, Visualization)](https://github.com/22Ujjwal/WintiML/blob/main/AssessmentQ1_program.sas)👀
**Learning SaS programming**, implemented using **PROC SQL**......Engineering with **SAS** is interesting!!

## 5. [SAS Data Predictive Model](https://github.com/22Ujjwal/WintiML/blob/main/Program2.sas) 🧩
This predictive model based on- Linear Regression, Logistic Regression(inlcudes odd ratios) and graph plotting of the given data set. [the program does data cleaning, manipulation, packaging for the statistical processing on the personalised data fields]

## 6. [Emotion and impression Analyzer](https://github.com/22Ujjwal/WintiML/tree/115f068956e3d437244575eaa76709fb75162ede/ComputerVision)
