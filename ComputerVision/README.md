# README for Computer Vision

I have built multiple Computer Vision recently, I realised that it best practise to add a readme documentation for users.

Step 1: Get all the files in the folder. And choose which program for CV you want to run. 
Step 2: make sure you have cascade file with you
Step 3: cd into same directory as the files, and do 

python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pyhton filename_u_wanna_run
